ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Namu! 

I am an award-winning journalist based in Boston, Massachusetts. My interests lie in public safety issues, including courts, cops & crime, culture, and transportation. 

When Iâ€™m not scouring through FOIAs, putting together data stories, or interviewing the interesting people I come across in my work, I enjoy trying new restaurants, finding a new TV show to watch (or binge!), and road-tripping.

Though I am a 2021 graduate of Boston University, where I received my Bachelor of Science in Journalism, I'm a lifelong lover of learning and broadening my horizons, which is why I am currently a student in the Lede program at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.

Welcome to my portfolio and please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect.
